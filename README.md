# Q-Repo Data Science Course Repository

**A community-curated repository of free and high-quality Data Science courses from leading institutions worldwide.**

---

## 📋 Repository Overview

This project serves as a structured, centralized knowledge base for **Data Science education**. It categorizes hundreds of free courses, tracks their stability, and provides direct access to learning materials from universities, tech companies, and online platforms. **This project is part of Q-Repo, a huge repository of free online courses for everyone. Hosted by the Quantum CyberSec Community**

## 🎓 Featured Course Picks by Level

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

This repository is organized into two main directories that classify courses by their **source** and by their **subject**.

### 1.  `/institutions` – Courses by Source
This directory organizes courses based on where they come from and how often they are updated.

####  **`/institutions/stable`**
Contains courses with **fixed, reliable links** that rarely change. These are perfect for structured learning paths.
- Each file corresponds to one institution (`google.md`, `university-michigan.md`)
- Contains a complete, manually verified list of that institution's AI/ML courses
- All links are expected to remain valid long-term

####  **`/institutions/dynamic`**
Contains portals to institutions with **large, frequently updated** course catalogs where maintaining individual links is impractical.
- Each file is a portal to an institution's main course directory (`udacity.md`)
- Provides search strategies and keywords to find relevant courses
- Examples: Udacity, Microsoft Learn

### 2. 📂 `/categories` – Courses by Topic
Organizes all courses by Data Science subject matter.

| Category File | Description | Example Topics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `statistics-mathematics.md` | Foundational math and statistical analysis | Probability, inferential stats, hypothesis testing, linear algebra |
| `programming-sql-r.md` | Core programming languages for data analysis | Python (Pandas, NumPy), R (tidyverse), SQL |
| `data-visualization.md` | Communicating insights through visuals | Matplotlib, Seaborn, ggplot2, Tableau, Power BI |
| `data-wrangling-cleaning.md` | Preparing raw data for analysis | Data cleaning, transformation, APIs, web scraping |
| `big-data-engineering.md` | Handling data at scale | Spark, Hadoop, data pipelines, cloud data services |

**How it works**: Each category file contains:
- A table of **stable courses** specifically on that topic.
- References to **dynamic institutions** that offer courses in that category.
- Recommended learning paths and prerequisite guidance.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository is a **community-curated collection** and is provided for informational purposes only.

*   **Accuracy Not Guaranteed**: While we strive for accuracy, we cannot guarantee that all information, links, or course details are current, correct, or complete. Institutions may update, move, or retire content without notice.
*   **Third-Party Content**: All courses and linked materials are the property of their respective institutions. This repository does not host any content itself; it only provides references, learning paths and links.
*   **Dynamic Changes**: Links in the `dynamic` institution portals are especially prone to change as platforms update their catalogs.
*   **User Verification**: We encourage users to verify course details, such as availability, pricing, and requirements, directly on the official provider's website before enrolling to any course.
