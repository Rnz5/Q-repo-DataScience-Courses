## 🧭 Learning Pathway

### **Absolute Beginners**
Start with introductory probability and descriptive statistics. Courses from CodeSignal or the first course in Duke's Statistics with R Specialization are excellent starting points.

### **Foundational Understanding**
Progress to inferential statistics, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis. The University of Michigan's "Statistics with Python" or Stanford's "Statistical Learning" provide this depth.

### **Specialization**
Choose between theoretical statistical learning (Stanford) or applied business statistics.
